# Contributing Guidelines

## Content Guide

* Deep dish pizza is not pizza and has no place in this project.
* **(Optional)** Wrap street addresses in a link with the anchor name `#address`, e.g.,  `[Prince Street Pizza](http://www.yelp.com/biz/prince-st-pizza-new-york)[27 Prince St](#address)`
* Update the geoJSON for the API with your pizzeria by running `ruby map_readme.rb` after you make your edits to the README file.

## Style Guide

* Prefer `*` to `-` for bulleted lists.
* Use a blank line beneath headings.
